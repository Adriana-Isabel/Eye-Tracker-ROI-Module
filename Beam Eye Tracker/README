Overview: Beam Eye Tracker & VSCode Adaptation

Beam Eye Tracker
    A dedicated eye-tracking device that accurately tracks a user’s gaze on a screen.
    Provides real-time gaze coordinates, fixations, and saccades through its proprietary software.

Typically includes:
    On-screen gaze overlay (a dot or ring showing where the user is looking)
    Calibration routines for each user
    Data export options (raw gaze, fixations, events)

Challenges with VSCode Integration
    The Beam device itself doesn’t directly connect to VSCode.
    Node.js/WebSocket scripts will fail (ECONNREFUSED) unless the Beam software exposes a developer API or WebSocket server.
    Many users cannot access a “developer mode,” so direct programmatic access is often blocked.

Workaround / Adaptation
    Use webcam-based gaze tracking libraries in VSCode:
    Examples: MediaPipe Face Mesh, WebGazer.js, OpenCV-based eye tracking
    Can track gaze, estimate fixations, and log events to CSV
    Runs entirely in Node.js, Python, or web environments without Beam hardware

Build a custom Beam-like experiment emulator:
    Calibration points on screen
    Real-time gaze dot (optional)
    Fixation detection (gaze stays in a region for a minimum duration)
    Data recording and CSV export   
    Accuracy is lower than Beam but fully controllable within VSCode

Conclusion
    Direct connection between Beam Eye Tracker and VSCode for real-time data is only possible with a developer API.
    Without that, you can emulate the Beam workflow using a standard webcam and software libraries, achieving similar experiments, fixation logging, and analysis within your development environment.
