Initial Testing of WebGazer.js for Webcam-Based Eye Tracking


1. Overview
    
    WebGazer.js is a browser-based, webcam-powered eye-tracking library designed for quick prototyping and lightweight research applications. It runs entirely in HTML/JavaScript and requires no installation, making it an accessible option for early ROI-tracking experiments in games and other interactive systems.



2. Setup & Ease of Use

    The setup process is extremely simple—adding a <script> tag that loads WebGazer.js is enough to begin capturing gaze data. A basic test environment can be built using only a single HTML file. The library automatically handles webcam access, face detection, and gaze estimation, so the learning curve is minimal.

    This simplicity makes WebGazer particularly appealing for rapid prototypes or classroom projects where time and computational resources are limited.



3. Real-Time Gaze Visualization

    During testing, the real-time visualization tool (the common red-dot cursor that follows estimated gaze position) worked but displayed noticeable instability. The dot tended to jump or jitter, especially when:

    - lighting conditions were uneven,

    - the head moved slightly,

    - or the camera resolution was low.

    This skittish behavior is expected in appearance-based webcam tracking, which lacks infrared illumination and high-resolution pupil tracking. However, the red-dot mode is mainly intended for debugging—not for research-grade accuracy.



4. Fixation Detection

    Despite the jittery movement during continuous tracking, WebGazer was able to detect fixation events more reliably. When the user looked at a single point on the screen for a brief period, the system stabilized enough to register consistent gaze estimates around that location.

    For many ROI-based applications (e.g., determining which UI element or game asset the player is looking at), fixation-level tracking is often more valuable than perfectly smooth continuous gaze.



5. Strengths Observed

    - Very easy to use: Runs in any modern browser; no installation or dependencies.

    - Lightweight: Works even on modest hardware.

    - Fast setup for experiments: Ideal for rapid prototyping.

    - Usable fixation detection: Despite noise, the system can reliably recognize when attention remains on a point.



6. Limitations Observed

    - Jitter during free-viewing: The real-time dot is unstable, especially with head movement.

    - Lighting sensitivity: Uneven or dim lighting noticeably affects performance.

    - Lower precision compared to IR-based or ML-based desktop trackers.

    These limitations are expected for any RGB-webcam–based eye tracker and are consistent with reports from existing WebGazer literature.



7. Suitability for ROI Tracking in Games

    Even with some jitter, WebGazer.js is suitable for:

    - detecting which region or UI element a player is looking at,

    - capturing general attention patterns,

    - running basic HCI or usability experiments.

    As long as ROIs are reasonably sized (buttons, panels, HUD zones), WebGazer can provide useful data when paired with simple smoothing or a short calibration routine.
